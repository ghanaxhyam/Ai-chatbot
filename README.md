I invite fellow developers and AI enthusiasts to collaborate and expand on this work. Let us dissect its mechanisms, probe its philosophical implications, and push the boundaries of conversational AI.
This chatbot project was my final year hustle at college. It's wired into the Gemini AI language model for next-level conversations, giving you that killer user experience.

Features
